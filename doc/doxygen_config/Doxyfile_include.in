#
# This file contains the paths to directories where to find the project
# headers, sources, Mardown (.md) and Dox (.dox) files (INPUT variable).
#
# This is a file to be copied by CMake (or by your own build script) to
# the build/ directory. The variable  is to be substituted
# by the actual path in the file system.
#
# Please remember that Doxygen will only parse files that correspond
# to the patterns defined in Doxyfile under the variable FILE_PATTERNS.
# If you don't want that a directory is searched by Doxygen but you
# do need that a specific file in that directory be included, just add
# the path to the file directly.
#
# Project's global includes and sources
# You enter here paths to directories where you have headers and sources
# that are not part of a component, e.g., headers defined in the architecture
# level.


#
# Component XXXX
# For each component in your project, you have to add the specific paths
# to be searched or to specific files to be included. The variable 
# IMAGE_PATH should point to the directory where possible images used
# in the Markdown file are stored. EXAMPLE_PATH is used by the \include
# command, which can be used in the Markdown file.
